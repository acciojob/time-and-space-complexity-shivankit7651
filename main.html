	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. It helps us determine whether an algorithm is efficient or not, by analyzing how quickly it grows as the input increases.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run to completion. It considers both fixed and variable parts of memory usage, and is often expressed using notations such as O(n).
